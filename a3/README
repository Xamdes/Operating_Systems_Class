Use cd to go to the folder a3 in command prompt.
Type make to create the program a3.
Running a3 will bring up a prompt to either type help for more commands
or to enter a number in seconds for how long the program to run.
Only entering the exit commands will cause the program to stop, else
it will just come to the prompt again after running the prgram.
Typing help brings up commands that may also be typed into the command prompt.
Such commands are:

First:   |Type any number from for the main program.
Second:  |Enter [end] or [exit] to terminate the program.
Third:   |Type [default] to reset the number back to default [6].
Fourth:	 |Type any number greater than [0] for the time in seconds the program should run for.

Lessons Learned:
Creating Shared Memory is difficult, but well worth the trouble. Finding the code to use shared 
memory was relatively easy. Thank you stackoverflow It took me awhile though to figure out what 
each command does when declaring a shared memory space.

Conclusion:

This project was a fun learning experience.
