Use cd to go to folder in command prompt
type make to create program sem
typing make clean will clean all *.o and delete sem
typing make remtxt will remove the PTAB.txt file,
which is created after running sem

When using sem type sem in command prompt and hit enter to start the executable
Enter 1 to run the program or enter anything else and it will quit.

The methods in functions.cc are made to be modular so it could potentially 
be used for other applications with few adjustments.

I have not found any bugs so far.

Lessons Learned:
	Never underestimate where to properly place sem_wait and sem_post
It was difficult learning to deal with race conditions.
	Man pages is everybodys best friend.
	Becareful where global variables are placed there is a difference between 
variables in a header file *.h and a source file *.cc.
